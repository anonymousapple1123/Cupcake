### Local LLM Codex Generator
```Currently under early development```

## What this promises to deliver

* Passively generates the documentation for your project.
* As there is physical limitation to how large model you can run or how large context length you can provide to your local model.This program tries to solve this issue by trading lack of hardware with time.
* The process will be slow but all of your project's documentation will be completed autonomously.
* AI doesn't modify the code in any way.

## Target Platforms 
```
Macos (Apple Silicon)
Linux (debian based)
```

```
What this can also be made to do -> Finding minor bugs/suggestions/appropriate comments in the entire project.
