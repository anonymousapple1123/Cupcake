Below are the documentations for all the shell scripts :

"cleanbuild.sh" -> compiles all the necessary files, runs the executable
                    and clean ups the excess files, simultaneously maintaining
                    the platform specific rules and prevents collisions.

"logclean.sh" -> removes all the files in logs and llm responses.

"run.sh" -> runs the appropriate file based on the system you are running.
